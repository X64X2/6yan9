## Intro

A gambling site with a meme coin :)

## Contributing

There's a lot of stuff wrong with this site.


### Prerequitites

* Apache web server (no you can't use nginx unless you can get .htaccess files to be interpereted, that is important) with php support
* Mysql database with proper entries (check the sql statement in the code, or I'll add the sql code later, who knows)

### Setup

1. Clone to /var/www/
2. Setup mysql database (mariadb is best) with a database named neow and two tables, users, and board.
3. Start mysql
4. Configure config.php with sql database settings
5. Add entry to apache config so the website runs
6. Convert to satanism
7. Start the apache web server.
