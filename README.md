a barebones password generator

- you must have an assembler installed on your machine before you try this

It takes a whopping 2kb of mem and will run on any pc that has a floppy

To use this disaster

- simply assemble it with an assembler **if you can find one** 

- load it up in DOS box 

- be in shock as it generates an utterly useless string of characters



> May the sauce be ever in your assembler.
